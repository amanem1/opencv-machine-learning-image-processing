# opencv-machine-learning-image-processing
This repo is for sharing all my learning with fellow coders in the field of computer visioning and in particular an popular  library  named OPENCV.(in python).
This canny detection code will run live by capturing through webcam rather using cv2.imread("file")
hope this helps others .
